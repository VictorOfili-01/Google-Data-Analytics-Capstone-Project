# Google-Data-Analytics-Capstone-Project
### This project is the result of my analysis of the Cyclistic bikeshare company's customers (fictitious). The goal of the company is to design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. My task is to find out how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently.
